				So you'd like to help contribute to the Grey H@t Root the Box?! That's great! We'd love to have your help!
				We've even made efforts to make contributing to the project as easy as possible! At this point in time, if you'd like to contribute,
				you must create an entire 'box', or group of flags, at a time. This box can be specified using a simple XML schema. The schema includes
				the following information:
			</p>
			<h5>Box</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>level - The level that the box should be added to. Valid values are 0 - 9. (REQ'D)</li>
				<li>name - The name to give the box. (REQ'D)</li>
				<li>difficulty - A string representing the difficulty of the level (e.g. Easy, Medium Hard). (REQ'D)</li>
				<li>avatar - The name of an image file (jpeg, png) to associate with the box. Aspect ratio should be 2w*1h. This image file must be supplied alongside the XML document. (REQ'D)</li>
				<li>description - A description of the box and the flags contained within it. This is the meat of the challenges, and should contain enough instruction for users to obtain the contained flags without requiring additional instruction. (REQ'D)</li>

As per Wikipedia, cryptography is &quot;the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.&quot; On a basic level, it is the idea of encoding data in such a way that (hopefully) ensures that only allowed parties can view the data. It is the digital version of the physical safe!

The foundations of modern cryptography are many times more complex than historical attempts at cryptography - modern crypto uses number theory and mathematical proofs to guarantee certain levels of privacy. However, crypto has been used as far back as 1,900 B.C. to help secure information from prying eyes!

The flags on this box cover some of the most elementary and well-known ciphers out there. First, let's take a look at the Caesar (or shift) cipher.

--- Caesar Cipher ---

Chances are that you have used a Caesar cipher at some point in your life. If you've ever seen the movie 'A Christmas Story,' you've seen one in action! A Caesar cipher is where the alphabet in which a message is written is shifted in a direction by a number of spaces. For instance, a Caesar cipher of +5 would take each letter of the alphabet and replace it with the letter that is 5 spots to the right of it. This would result in the following transformations:

A -&gt; F
B -&gt; G
C -&gt; H
D -&gt; I
...
Z -&gt; E

Using this Caesar cipher of +5, let's encrypt the phrase 'helloworld' with it:

'helloworld' - original
'mjqqtbtwqi' - encrypted with Caesar cipher of +5

It's as simple as that! Needless to say, a Caesar cipher does not provide very much security!

--- Flags ---

1 - Apply a Caesar cipher of -3 on the phrase 'thisshouldbefun'
	&lt;/description&gt;
